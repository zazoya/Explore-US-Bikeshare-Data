# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the USâ€”Chicago, NYC, and Washington. It imports the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
